/**
 * The `wizard-completion-step` component can be used to define a completion/success step at the end of your wizard
 * After a `wizard-completion-step` has been entered, it has the characteristic that the user is blocked from
 * leaving it again to a previous step.
 * In addition entering a `wizard-completion-step` automatically sets the `wizard` amd all steps inside the `wizard`
 * as completed.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * ```html
 * <wizard-completion-step [stepTitle]="title of the wizard step" [navigationSymbol]="navigation symbol"
 *    [navigationSymbolFontFamily]="navigation symbol font family"
 *    (stepEnter)="event emitter to be called when the wizard step is entered"
 *    (stepExit)="event emitter to be called when the wizard step is exited">
 *    ...
 * </wizard-completion-step>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```html
 * <wizard-completion-step stepTitle="Step 1" navigationSymbol="1">
 *    ...
 * </wizard-completion-step>
 * ```
 *
 * With a navigation symbol from the `font-awesome` font:
 *
 * ```html
 * <wizard-completion-step stepTitle="Step 1" navigationSymbol="&#xf1ba;" navigationSymbolFontFamily="FontAwesome">
 *    ...
 * </wizard-completion-step>
 * ```
